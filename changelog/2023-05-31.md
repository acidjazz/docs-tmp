### Wolfi support

Wolfi is a community Linux undistro designed for the container and cloud-native era. Chainguard started the Wolfi project to enable building Chainguard Images, Chainguard's collection of curated distroless images that meet the requirements of a secure software supply chain. This required a Linux distribution with components at the appropriate granularity and with support for both glibc and musl, something that was not yet available in the cloud-native Linux ecosystem.
