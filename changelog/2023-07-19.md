### New Index: nist-nvd

### Multi-region support for backups

We now keep stored backups in multiple regions in the U.S. and across the globe. Upon requesting a backup, we will send you to the region closest and/or with minimal latency. This will make sure you get your data as fast as possible, and will provide failover if a region is down. Our current list of supported regions are:

* Northern Virginia
* Oregon
* Sydney, Australia
* London, England
