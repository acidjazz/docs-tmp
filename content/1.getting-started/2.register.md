## Portal Authentication

To register or login to the VulnCheck platform, you will need to login to the portal via OAuth 2.0 (Google) or via an Email Link. Alternatively, you may also login with a Verification Code sent via email. The Verification Code is useful for cases where an automated system, such as Email Security applications, are clicking the Email Links in the VulnCheck emails.
