VulnCheck Exploit & Vulnerability Intgelligence service provides vulnerability aliases, CVSS temporal scores, vulnerability categorization data, and embeds rich exploit intelligence to go well above and beyond what the NVD provides.

VulnCheck Exploit & Vulnerability Intelligence is an autonomous system that tracks dozens of vendor and government advisories, and then marries that data with best-in-class exploit intelligence from VulnCheck.

## NVD Migration

VulnCheck Exploit & Vulnerability Intelligence makes it easy to migrate from using the NIST National Vulnerability Database (NVD) to using VulnCheck Vulnerability Intelligence as your primary source of vulnerability information.

To start, if you already consume the NIST National Vulnerability Database (NVD), you're likely aware of the challenges, such as frequent API timeouts and the fact that NVD 1.0 (the version of NVD that everyone is using) is in the process of being deprecated, in favor of NVD 2.0.

If you're a licensed paid subscriber of VulnCheck Exploit & Vulnerability Intelligence, it's easy to begin using NVD 1.0, NVD 2.0, NVD 1.0 with VulnCheck extensions, or NVD 2.0 with VulnCheck extensions.

At this time, VulnCheck would recommend new customers start with NVD 2.0 with VulnCheck extensions. To download this offline backup, simply call:

::code-group
```sh [curl]
curl --request GET \
     --cookie "TOKEN=insert_token_here"
     --url https://api.vulncheck.com/v3/backup/vulncheck-nvd2 \
     --header 'Accept: application/json' \
```
```go [Go]
client := &http.Client{}
var responseJSON interface{}
request, _ := http.NewRequest("GET", "https://api.vulncheck.com/v3/backup/vulncheck-nvd2", nil)
request.Header.Set("Accept", "application/json")
request.AddCookie(&http.Cookie{
    Name:    "token",
    Value:   "insert_token_here",
})

response, _ := http.DefaultClient.Do(req)
defer res.Body.Close()
_ := json.NewDecoder(response.Body).Decode(responseJSON)
```

```python [Python]
import requests
url = "https://api.vulncheck.com/v3/backup/vulncheck-nvd2"
headers = {
    "accept": "application/json"
}
cookies = {
    "token": "insert_token_here"
}

response = requests.get(url, headers=headers, cookies=cookies)
print(response.json())

```

VulnCheck Exploit & Vulnerability Intelligence includes four (4) versions of NVD. These include:

| Index | Source | Description |
| ----- | ------ | ----------- |
| vulncheck-nvd2 | VulnCheck | NVD 2.0 with VulnCheck extensions (more fields and earlier data) |
| vulncheck-nvd | VulnCheck | NVD 1.0 with VulnCheck extensions (more fields and earlier data) |
| nist-nvd2 | NIST | NVD 2.0 with an SLA |
| nist-nvd | NIST | NVD 1.0 with an SLA, generated from NVD 2.0, so it won't be subject to deprecation |
