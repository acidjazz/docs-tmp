VulnCheck Exploit & Vulnerability Intelligence tracks package dependencies across a wide range of programming language package managers and Operating System package managers.

For tracked packages, VulnCheck includes vulnerability, license, and fix information when possible.

## Query by Package URL

To query for vulnerabilities by Package URL (purl), simply call /v3/purl?purl=:purl as follows:

::code-group
```sh [curl]
curl --request GET \
     --cookie "TOKEN=insert_token_here"
     --url https://api.vulncheck.com/v3/purl?purl=pkg:pypi/aioxmpp@0.6.0 \
     --header 'Accept: application/json' \
```
```go [Go]
client := &http.Client{}
var responseJSON interface{}
request, _ := http.NewRequest("GET", "https://api.vulncheck.com/v3/purl?purl=pkg:pypi/aioxmpp@0.6.0", nil)
request.Header.Set("Accept", "application/json")
request.AddCookie(&http.Cookie{
    Name:    "token",
    Value:   "insert_token_here",
})

response, _ := http.DefaultClient.Do(req)
defer res.Body.Close()
_ := json.NewDecoder(response.Body).Decode(responseJSON)
```

```python [Python]
import requests
url = "https://api.vulncheck.com/v3/purl?purl=pkg:pypi/aioxmpp@0.6.0"
headers = {
    "accept": "application/json"
}
cookies = {
    "token": "insert_token_here"
}

response = requests.get(url, headers=headers, cookies=cookies)
print(response.json())

```
::

The above example requests a list of vulnerabilities in version 0.6.0 of the aioxmpp package from pypi.

## Download Offline Backup

To request a specific offline backup, simply call /v3/backup/:index as follows:

::code-group
```sh [curl]
curl --request GET \
     --cookie "TOKEN=insert_token_here"
     --url https://api.vulncheck.com/v3/backup/gem \
     --header 'Accept: application/json' \
```
```go [Go]
client := &http.Client{}
var responseJSON interface{}
request, _ := http.NewRequest("GET", "https://api.vulncheck.com/v3/backup/gem", nil)
request.Header.Set("Accept", "application/json")
request.AddCookie(&http.Cookie{
    Name:    "token",
    Value:   "insert_token_here",
})

response, _ := http.DefaultClient.Do(req)
defer res.Body.Close()
_ := json.NewDecoder(response.Body).Decode(responseJSON)
```

```python [Python]
import requests
url = "https://api.vulncheck.com/v3/backup/gem"
headers = {
    "accept": "application/json"
}
cookies = {
    "token": "insert_token_here"
}

response = requests.get(url, headers=headers, cookies=cookies)
print(response.json())

```
::

> The above example requests an offline backup for the "gem" index, which is the index tracking Ruby Gems. Note: downloading an offline backup requires a paid subscription license to VulnCheck.
