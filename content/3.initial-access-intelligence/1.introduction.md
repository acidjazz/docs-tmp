According to Mandiant, Initial Access vulnerabilities and their subsequent exploitation was the leading source of data breaches in 2022. VulnCheck's Initial Access Intelligence product provides detection artifacts in a timely manner, so that organizations can respond to these emerging threats more quickly.

VulnCheck's Initial Access Intelligence product provides organizations with in-house developed exploit PoCs, packet captures (PCAP files), Suricata & Snort signatures to detect exploitation, YARA rules (when possible), CPE strings, version scanners, mapping to GreyNoise tags, and measuring Internet-level exposure of potentially vulnerable systems using Censys & Shodan. VulnCheck packages these detection artifacts for organizations to detect & respond.
