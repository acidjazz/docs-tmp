description: "The VulnCheck Initial Access Intelligence product covers a limited subset of known vulnerabilities, those vulnerabilities likely to become widely exploited in the future."

VulnCheck Initial Access Intelligence covers [Initial Access Vulnerabilities](/glossary/terms#initial-access-vulnerability), sometimes referred to as Remote Code Execution (RCE) vulnerabilities, which are remote in nature, and typically do not require credentials to exploit.

VulnCheck aims to author, in-house, detection artifacts for [Initial Access Vulnerabilities](/glossary/terms#initial-access-vulnerability) already being used in attacks in the wild, or likely to be used in attacks in the wild in the near future. VulnCheck aims to provide coverage before vulnerabilities show up in exploited in the wild lists, such as the CISA KEV catalog.
