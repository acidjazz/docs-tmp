title: "Detection Artifacts"
description: "The VulnCheck Initial Access Intelligence product includes detection artifacts in a wide range of formats, to enable defenders to quickly detect & respond to emerging threats."
---

VulnCheck's Initial Access Intelligence product provides organizations with in-house developed exploit PoCs, packet captures (PCAP files), Suricata & Snort signatures to detect exploitation, YARA rules (when possible), CPE strings, version scanners, mapping to GreyNoise tags, and measuring Internet-level exposure of potentially vulnerable systems using Censys & Shodan. VulnCheck packages these detection artifacts for organizations to detect & respond.

Our detection artifacts enable organizations to respond to the latest vulnerabilities, likely to be involved in widespread attacks and data breaches, by implementing defensive measures and testing their security posture.

## Detection Artifacts Included

Licensed subscribers of VulnCheck Initial Access Intelligence are able to download the following detection artifacts for covered vulnerabilities:

| Detection Artifact | Description |
| ------------------ | ----------- |
| Exploit PoC |	In-house developed Exploit PoC designed to test whether devices or applications are actually vulnerable |
| Version Scanner |	A version scanner, wired into the Exploit PoC, designed to assess whether systems are vulnerable based on a version, without sending exploit payload |
| Packet Capture (PCAP) | A packet capture (PCAP) of the Exploit PoC exploiting a vulnerable system |
| Suricata Rule | A Suricata or Snort rule designed to detect the exploitation of the vulnerability over the network |
| Snort Rule | A Suricata or Snort rule designed to detect the exploitation of the vulnerability over the network |
| YARA Rule |	A YARA rule designed to detect the exploit on an endpoint |

## Metadata Available

In addition to the above detection artifacts (files), VulnCheck Initial Access includes metadata about the potential exposure of the vulnerability.
