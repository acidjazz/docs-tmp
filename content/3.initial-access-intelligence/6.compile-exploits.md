title: "Compile Exploit Code"
description: "To compile the VulnCheck provided exploit proof of concept code, fetch go-exploit from GitHub."

VulnCheck's Initial Access Intelligence product provides organizations with in-house developed exploit PoCs, packet captures (PCAP files), Suricata & Snort signatures to detect exploitation, YARA rules (when possible), CPE strings, version scanners, mapping to GreyNoise tags, and measuring Internet-level exposure of potentially vulnerable systems using Censys & Shodan. VulnCheck packages these detection artifacts for organizations to detect & respond.

VulnCheck's exploit proof of concept code is written in the Go programming language. The exploit PoCs themselves are self-contained, but leverage an Open Source Software (OSS) shared library, which VulnCheck has authored an open sourced, called [go-exploit](git@github.com:vulncheck-oss/go-exploit.git).

To fetch [go-exploit](git@github.com:vulncheck-oss/go-exploit.git), simply call:

```sh
git clone git@github.com:vulncheck-oss/go-exploit.git
```

Once the shared library is fetched and the Go environment is setup, the exploit PoCs may be compiled.
