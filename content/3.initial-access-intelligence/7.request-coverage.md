VulnCheck's Initial Access Intelligence product provides organizations with in-house developed exploit PoCs, packet captures (PCAP files), Suricata & Snort signatures to detect exploitation, YARA rules (when possible), CPE strings, version scanners, mapping to GreyNoise tags, and measuring Internet-level exposure of potentially vulnerable systems using Censys & Shodan. VulnCheck packages these detection artifacts for organizations to detect & respond.

If there are CVEs that would be helpful for your organization to cover, where in-depth analysis & detection artifacts would be helpful, please reach out to VulnCheck.
