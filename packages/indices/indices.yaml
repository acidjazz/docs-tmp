    struct: advisory.OpenSSLSecAdv{}
    desc: OpenSSL Security Advisories are official communications issued by the
      OpenSSL project, an open-source software library that provides
      cryptographic functions to protect communications over computer networks.
      These advisories are designed to provide information and guidance on
      potential security vulnerabilities and threats affecting OpenSSL software.
      OpenSSL Security Advisories typically include technical details about the
      vulnerability or issue, as well as recommended remediation and risk
      mitigation steps. They may also include severity ratings and CVSS scores
      to help organizations prioritize their response to potential security
      incidents. The OpenSSL security team works closely with the community to
      identify and address security concerns, and is committed to providing
      timely and effective security advisories to help protect user data and
      sensitive information. OpenSSL Security Advisories cover a wide range of
      topics, including vulnerabilities related to key management, cryptographic
      weaknesses, and protocol issues. By providing regular updates and guidance
      on potential security threats, OpenSSL helps to ensure the ongoing
      security and reliability of its software for its users. Additionally,
      OpenSSL encourages open and transparent collaboration with the community
      to help identify and address potential security concerns, making it an
      important component of secure communications infrastructure.
